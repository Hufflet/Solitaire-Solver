Updating position in location table
- happens where the card is actually placed

locations:
- hand: 0
- tabs: 1-7 (left to right)
- fnds: 8-11 (in order of suit)

Push-Pull method
- each move has a from (push) and a to (pull)
- for the push location
  - if tab, set push to true, pull to false
  - if fnd, set push to true, pull to false
- for the pull location
  - if tab, set pull to false, keep push what it was
  - if fnd, set pull to true, push to false

Move
- type
  - if moving, need push/pull locations
    - need to know if new card was revealed
    - need to know how many moved if new card was revealed
  - if flipping, need number that are flipped
  - if resetting, don't really need much
- for all cases, need to know the push-pull state before move
